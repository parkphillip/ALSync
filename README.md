NOTE**: This repository is a work in progress as I continue compiling, refining, and documenting the development process for both Prototype 1 and Prototype 2. While most of the code for Prototype 2 has been consolidated, I am still retracing my exact process for integrating and modifying existing frameworks like MindAffect, OpenViBE, and MNE-Python. Additionally, I am yet to locate and document all the failed iterations and experiments for Prototype 1 to provide a complete developmental history.

ALSync is a cost-effective, open-source Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) designed to provide an accessible assistive communication solution for individuals with ALS. This repository includes the codebases for both Prototype 1 and the improved Prototype 2, showcasing the progression of the systemâ€™s development. Built using modular frameworks like MindAffect, OpenViBE, and MNE-Python, ALSync integrates advanced signal processing pipelines, personalized decoding algorithms, and efficient hardware setups.

Stay tuned for updates!
